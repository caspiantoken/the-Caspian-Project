the Caspian Blockchain
Caspian blockchain will be a Decentralized, fast and secure network with no transaction fees. The cost of the transaction will be on the developer and not the user. The Transaction Fee for Caspian Coin will be Zero. 
Initially, the transaction Costs of Caspian coin will be paid by the founding team. With the creation of different tokens on the Caspian network, the transaction fees of these tokens will be used to pay for the transaction costs of the Caspian coin.
Originally our blockchain will use DPOS mechanism but we will examine the possibility of a hybrid multilayer blockchain using POW and DPOS mechanisms. We may use the POW mechanism in the Settlement layer and DPOS in the application layer to experience a real decentralized and fast system. There will be other intermediate layers to enhance blockchain. Our goal is to find an optimum point between transaction speed and security and decentralization. So we will do our best to use innovative ideas to avoid weaknesses of previous blockchans and improve their advantages. 
Caspian blockchain will be a good platform for making, buying and selling, auctioning NFT tokens based on the Caspian network.
